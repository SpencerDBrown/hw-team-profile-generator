# hw-team-profile-generator

This weeks assignment was a bit tricky, took me a few attempts and this is my third repo I have made for it. Been having a few issues with GitHub / GitHub Pages for a while now, so apologies if there are any errors with the submission, ill try my best to resubmit if so. (Due to my own error of causing my own problems!) Unlike the read-me generator or HTML generator we did in class, this was a bit more intricate. The other two were straightforward and this one I had to do some digging to really figure out where exactly my problems were. A few problems I ran into were errors between the files, primarly syntax. One file I wrote "getID" the other I wrote "getId". Its a bit embarrassing to admit how long it took for me to notice this, but thats apart of learning I guess! All in all, it was a fun build and finally seeing it work and be functional was such an astonishingly refreshing feeling!
